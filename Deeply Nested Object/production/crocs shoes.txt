crocs shoes
description:
Crocs, Inc. is an American footwear company based in Broomfield, Colorado, that manufactures and markets the Crocs brand of foam footwear. Crocs Inc. terms these "clogs", but they do not contain any wood like traditional clogs.
 


origin of crocs:
Crocs made its debut to the world in 2002, after co-founders Scott Seamans, Lyndon Hanson, and George Boedbecker Jr. went sailing in Mexico, and Seamens showed his two friends a boating clog he’d been working on with a Canadian company called Foam Creations. The shoe was constructed out of Croslite, a new type of resin that is lightweight and odor-resistant. Despite thinking the shoe was ugly at first, they were sold on its functionality and the ease with which it performed both on land and in water, much like the semi-aquatic reptiles that would inspire the brand’s name.
 
 
became a fashion icon:
With more and more young idols using Crocs in their outfits, young people are beginning to think that horror is beauty. Unique, versatile, do-it-yourself decor, a variety of colors to choose from, and comfortable features make Crocs a popular fashion item for young people.
 
 
my crocs time
I bought a pair of Crocs last year on the recommendation of a friend, and I didn't want to buy them at first because I didn't think the look of Crocs was beautiful to me. But when I started wearing those Crocs, I fell completely in love with them. Because it is very loose, it is as comfortable as wearing slippers. And it's waterproof, and it also works well with clothes. So it was an amazing experience.
